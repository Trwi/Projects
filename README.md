# Projects
This is a collection of projects I have worked on since beginning my programming and cyber security journey. I have completed several other Python programs as a part of my Violent Python course that are not included. I chose not to include them, because we were given starter programs written by the professor to complete with our added code. Every program on this page is one hundred percent my code.

I included the monalisa.bmp file if you want to run the steganography programs.

Please reach out if you have any questions, or you want me to write a specific program for consideration.
